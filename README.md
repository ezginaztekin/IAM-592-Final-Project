# IAM-592-Final-Project
In this project, I write a basic game including historical cryptography ciphers and
their analyses to find plaintexts and ciphertexts with keys. To do this, I used all historical ciphers such as ceaser cipher, shift cipher, affine cipher, hill cipher, vigenere cipher, substitution cipher, permutation cipher. This game includes their encryptions, decryptions and cryptographic analyses. 

## Shift Cipher 
Shift Cipher is one of the most widely known cryptographic technique which is based on modular arithmetic. In shift cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by left or right n.letter. 

In encrytion, the letter x is shifted to n step right, 
$$E_{n}(x)=(x + n)\mod {26}$$

In decryption, the letter x is shifted to n step left,
$$D_{n}(x)=(x - n)\mod {26}$$ 


## Ceaser Cipher
This is the special shift cipher. Only difference is n is fixed number 3. This means that, 

In encrytion, the letter x is shifted to n step right, 
$$E_{3}(x)=(x + 3)\mod {26}$$

In decryption, the letter x is shifted to n step left,
$$D_{3}(x)=(x - 3)\mod {26}$$ 


## Hill Cipher 





# Vigenere Cipher




# Affine Cipher
